I am Alexandra Shikunova, although I prefer Sasha. I am currently a 4th year bachelor student of linguistics at HSE University (Moscow), a research assistant at HSE Laboratory in Formal Models in Linguistics and a data scientist at Sberbank. I am interested in phonology (Strict CV in particular) and its interactions with morphosyntax, as well as morphosyntax itself.
