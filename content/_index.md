My name is Sasha Shikunova. I graduated from HSE University (Moscow) with a bachelor's in fundamental and computational linguistics and am currently studying for an MA in theoretical linguistics. I work as a research assistant at HSE Laboratory in Formal Models in Linguistics and as an NLP ingénieure at Sberbank. I am interested in phonology (Strict CV in particular) and its interactions with morphosyntax, as well as morphosyntax itself.

Here is my [:pager:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thddbptnsndshs/curriculae-vitae/master/ENG_academic/cv.pdf) academic CV.
