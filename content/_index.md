I am Sasha Shikunova, a 4th year undergraduate student of linguistics at HSE University (Moscow), a research assistant at HSE Laboratory in Formal Models in Linguistics and an NLP ingénieure at Sberbank. I am interested in phonology (Strict CV in particular) and its interactions with morphosyntax, as well as morphosyntax itself.

Here is my [:pager:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thddbptnsndshs/curriculae-vitae/master/ENG_academic.pdf) curriculum vitae.
