it was the biggest challenge on my academic way so far. i can't believe i have completed it. teaching really does teach the teacher, doesn't it. i want to study and be a student so much more now! please find [the course on stress](https://github.com/thddbptnsndshs/EGG_stress_in_cvcv) and [the course on Uralic phonology](https://github.com/thddbptnsndshs/EGG_stress_in_cvcv) on github.
