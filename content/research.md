# Research

I do a lot of different projects, all of which are pretty small but with a chance of growing into something big one day.

## Morphophonological alternations in Uralic languages

Anything that happens at morpheme boundaries draws my interest, and since I am exposed to some underresearched Uralic languages, I study them with a CVCV lens. I have looked at glide insertion in Moksha, which occurs in between /u i/-final bases and vowel-initial suffixes and is superficially dependent on syllable count. Also, I have worked on modeling the schwa-zero alternations in Kazym Khanty, to no publishable avail so far.

## Syntax of non-finite modal constructions in Uralic languages

Constructions that look half verbal and half nominal often make curious puzzles. Such is, for example, the so-called mermaid construction in Kazym Khanty, which I argue to be biclausal, contrary to Tsunoda (2020). In Moksha, I have analysed a nominalisation with a debitive meaning, which exhibits an interesting case \& agreement pattern.

## Russian phrasal comparatives

I believe that no existing analysis of the Russian comparative is completely satisfactory. There are two major types of comparatives in Russian: one is uncontroversially clausal but the other, despite seeming phrasal, has been claimed to contain a small clause (Pancheva 2006, Philippova 2017). I defend a direct analysis for the second type of Russian comparatives, that is, that it is genuinely phrasal.

## Russian stress shift

Russian prepositional phrases are phonological words, where the preposition is unstressed in most cases. Sometimes, however, the stress can shift to the preposition. Daniar Kasenov and I have explored this phenomenon, outlining the morphosyntactic and phonological conditions on the stress shift.
